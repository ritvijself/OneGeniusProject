              Service. The legal bases for 1GeniusSEO’s processing of personal
              data are primarily that the processing is necessary for providing
              the Service in accordance with 1GeniusSEO’s Terms of Service and
              that the processing is carried out in 1GeniusSEO’s legitimate

              individual. You may provide us with Personal Data in various ways
              on the Service. For example, when you register for an Account, use
              the Service, interact with other users of the Service through

            </h5>

              Many features, functions, or elements of the 1 Genius SEO Services

              clause: “The use of an Account is subject to a Fee. Upon sign-up
              for an Account, the User must select a Plan. Different rates apply
              to different Plans. The applicable Fee is charged in advance on
              monthly or annual payment intervals, unless agreed otherwise
              between parties. All Fees are non-refundable, i.e., there are no
              refunds or credits for periods where the User did not use an
              activated Account, used it only partially, or deactivated the
              Account or terminated these Terms during an ongoing payment
              interval. If, after signing up, User elects to upgrade to a more
              expensive Plan, the unused portion of any prepaid Fees shall be
              applied to the Fee of the more expensive Plan.”

              designs and custom URLs, will be processed automatically on
              client’s credit card as soon as client confirms order, before
              development begins.
            </p>
            <h5 className={styles.subSectionTitle}>4.3 Changing Plans</h5>

              Future clause: “Any User has the right to upgrade or downgrade a
              current Plan at any time by selecting a new Plan among the
              collection of Plans determined by the Supplier. In such an event,
              the Client’s credit card on file with the Supplier will
              automatically be charged with a Fee for the next payment interval
              with the rate stipulated in the new Plan.”

            <h5 className={styles.subSectionTitle}>4.4 Free Trial</h5>

              days, if the parties have not agreed otherwise. The User is not
              required to provide any credit card information during the period
              of Free Trial. If the period of Free Trial has expired, the
              Account will be automatically deactivated. In order to prevent
              deactivation or to reactivate the Account, the User is required to
              select a suitable Plan and pay the first Fee.
